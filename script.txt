American Elm -
Elm trees are stately deciduous trees found in the eastern 2/3 of North America. They are the state tree for both MA and ND. Massachusetts chose American Elm as it was the tree species Georgia Washington stood beneath when he assumed command of the Continental Army in 1775. 
American Elm trees are rapidy growing, and may grow to be 50 feet tall in only 20 years. At full maturity, they can reach up to 150 feet.
simple, broad flat leaves, without unbalaned lobes, glossy and double-toothed.


Juniper Tree -
Common juniper, also known as (Juniperus communis), is an evergreen conifer which is native Britain, Europe and large parts of the northern hemisphere. It is usually a low growing shrub. The brown bark turns grey and peels with age. The needle-like leaves are green with silver edging. If you crush the leaves they will smell of lemon or apple.  Juniper provide important cover to nesting birds. Its berries are used to flavor gin. They are indominatable plants, typically living between 350 and 700 years before going to tree heaven.


Weeping Willow - 
Salix babylonica, or the weeping willow, is a graceful giant known for its gently dropping tendril-like branches and long, slender leaves. It is a fast-growing tree that grows especially well near water but has some drought tolerance. The Weeping willow was indiginous to China and cuttings made their way westward in early trade routes.  Artists' sketching coal is often made from processed willow bark, and the tree is often included in paintings from the Victorian era to symbolize death.

Beech -
Beech trees are conical, spreading trees, with a canopy of up to 40' in diameter. Notable for their smooth, grey bark, and its branches are rated at medium strength.  They have dark, glossy green leaves, 3-6" long with sawtoothed edges. They produce both male and female flowers on the same tree, with pale, brown, unshowy blooms.  They produce beechnuts, which are delicious and attract a variety of wildlife, making the beech tree a rife stage for the folleys and foibles of forest life.

9 - 
The best way to harvest beechnuts is to pick them off the trees before they start to fall naturally. However, if the nuts have reached maturity and have fallen into the humus and dried leaves of the forest floor, a blanket or tarp, and a little effort will net plenty.

Although it is easier to extract the tiny kernels before the nuts lose all of their moisture, the meats of well-dried nuts are more crisp (and perhaps more tasty). Roasting the nuts in an oven or on the top of a wood-burning stove also produces good results.

Wafting Trident -
The wafting trident is a small, hardy tree prevalent in hot, dry climes. The tiny light green leaves dot the entirety of its wide, gnarled, and almost entirely hollow trunk. The characteristic three primary branches of the trident begin development in the tree's third year and continue their slow growth of 2 cm per year for the entire lifespan of the Wafting Trident, which we now understand can last over 2000 years. The Trident does not provide shade as its foliage never leaves the bud stage, but rather has adapted to waft and totter in the breeze, increasing its airflow and exposure to sun. The Trident's buds are poisonous until they have reached full maturity and are shed to the ground, making a great feast for desert rodents and omnivorous reptiles.


Sugar Maple -
The Sugar Maple tree is one of America's most well-loved trees - servings as the state tree to four different states in the USA. Wow! it develops a dense crown of leaves, with a spread of 50' and a height of 75' at maturity. It should not be planted in confined spaces where salt is a problem. In the 2001 baseball season, Barry Bonds switched from the traditional ash wood baseball bat to one made of maple and hit 73 home runsâ€”a new record!



Birch - Birch trees - genus Betula, Family Betulacae, in the Order Fagales, making these trees close cousins with Oak and Beech trees. A thin-leaved, deciduous hardwood tree, they are prized for their outstanding white, peeling bark and graceful foliage. They are sensitive trees. Their shallow root system thrives in cool, moist soil, making them susceptible to even brief droughts - yet their leaves require full, bright sun. 
Birch sap, also known as birch blood, had a folk reputation for breaking kidney or bladder stone and treating skin conditions and rheumatic diseases. It can be drunk in spring as a refreshing and cleansing tonic, clearing the sluggishness of winter from the system.  Birch leaves and bark can be boiled down to extract oil and tar. Quite a useful tree!
